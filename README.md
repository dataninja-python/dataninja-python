- 👋 Hi, I’m AJ. In 2023, I founded a data science-driven financial engineering research and development firm focused on democratizing ethical, transparent AI usage.
- 🤖 The firm tests its proprietary mathematic, algorithmic, data science, computer science, and other breakthroughs by using them in businesses, investments, and open-source projects.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 The tightly-knit team is a by-invite-only collective of talented partners with experience and expertise in wide range of fields and industries.
- 👀 Together, we build upon the unique problem solving philosophy I've been creating and testing for over two decades.
- 🌱 From a software engineering perspective, I prefer to build prototypes to solve problems where solutions must be mathematically provably accurate using Haskell, where flexibility is paramount using Lisp and Python, where communication is key using Elixir/Erlang, and where computation is intensive using Go and Rust. Production systems are built using "the right tools for the job." Thus, the final work is a combination of modular components written in different languages as needed - including Fortran, C, C++, Java, VBA, F#, C#, TypeScript, Swift, Kotlin, Html, CSS/SASS, and JavaScript. As a hobby, I experiment with frameworks, languages, and technologies to constantly improve my understanding and stay relevant. For front-end work currently, I, like most these days, use React or vanilla HTML/CSS/SASS with TypeScript or JavaScript adding functionality. However, I am actively looking for opportunities to use my Elm, Purescript, Svelte, Vue, and Angular skills in production. 
- :worried: about building my first video game physics engine. I don't even know where to start but it is slowly, very slowly based on the exploding size of this github, moving up my hobby projects backlog. 🤔
