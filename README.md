- 👋 Hi, I’m AJ. In 2023, I founded a data science-driven financial engineering research and development firm.
- 🤖 The firm uses proprietary mathematic, algorithmic, and other breakthroughs to run an AI managed globally opportunistic, quantamental hedge fund.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 The tightly-knit team is a by-invite-only collective of co-invested partners with experience and expertise in wide range of fields and industries.
- 👀 Together, we build upon the unique problem solving philosophy and investment theses I've been testing for over two decades. I apply these concepts - as well as data science, mathematics, financial engineering, and technology skills - to solving interesting problems for a few select external consulting clients each year.
- 🌱 From a software engineering perspective, I prefer to build prototypes to solve mathematic heavy problems using Haskell, to solve novel AI algorithm-related ones in Lisp or Python, and build production systems using the right tools for the job with a preference for Go, Typescript (TS), or Javascript (JS), and Rust. As required, for example if the current tech stack is built upon it, I am open to using C, C++, Java, and am willing to learn other languages/frameworks. As a hobby, I experiement with lots of old and new frameworks, languages, and technologies to constantly improve my understanding and stay relevant. For front-end work currently, I, like most these days, use react or vanilla HTML/CSS/SASS with TS or JS adding functionality. However, I am actively looking for opportunities to use Elm, Purescript, Svelte, Vue, and Angular. Finally, Elixir and Erlang are interesting languages I have been exploring.
- :worried: about building my first video game physics engine. I don't even know where to start but it is slowly, very slowly based on the exploding size of this github, moving up my hobby projects backlog. 🤔
- 🥇Accomplishments: former McKinsey & Company Business Analyst. Developed unique investment intellectual property that helped achieve top-quartile peer returns in private equity over a decade. Combined learnings from data science, programming, mathematics, entreneurship, VC, and private equity to create proprietary research and modeling frameworks. Founded several successful businesses - the first at the age of 11. Worked as CFO for several middle market and start up firms. Helped achieve a 25%+ savings across a 37 property real estate lease portfolio in 5 months. Proud undergraduate Emory University and Goizueta Business School alum.
- ⏰ Active Projects: Building out the technology platform for the firm's first VC investment - outside of itself. Building economic management, AI-assisted search, and advanced peer-to-peer architected exchange. Creating the mini-habit of daily blogging to hold myself accountable to achieving long
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate on interesting problems, ideas, concepts, or open-source projects or consulting on challenging problems where unconventional thinking, an algorithmic approach, and data science will provide a unique edge. Feel free to contact me: aj at redstonema dot com.
