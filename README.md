- 👋 Hi, I’m AJ. I was in the market for a while but now run a proprietary R&D firm.
- 👀 I’ve developed a unique problem solving philosophy currently in testing. I'm open to consulting on tough problems with high uncertainty.
- 🌱 I prototype in Python, display work using Typescript/JavaScript, but love Lisp and Haskell. I'm functional with C++ and Java to plug our work into existing systems. I hope to pick up more Rust, Go, Elixir/Erlang, and Racket.
- :worried: about building my first video game physics engine. I don't even know where to start.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborating. Let's do a hackathon, write a whitepaper, conduct some research, do a codejam, or whatever.
