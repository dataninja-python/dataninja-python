- 👋 Hi, I’m AJ.
- 👀 I’m interested in working with startups to improve their technology product/market fit.
- 🌱 I’m currently in love with Rust, Haskell, and Lisp (Racket)...and picking up some Java (for a Masters program).
- :worried: I'm a little stressed I won't be able to build this WASM physics engine I started for a game. Wish me luck...oh I should upload it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate. Let's do a hackathon,codejam, or whatever.
- 📫 How to reach me: the [dot] coders [dot] dao [at] gmail [dot] com. NOTE: I use a Haskell program to parse spam. Let me know if it's working TOO well.
- :dash: Gotta run. As usual, I've got a deadline. Contact me above.
